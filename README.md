# Face Detection and Recognition Project

Welcome to our Face Detection and Recognition project, where we harness the power of Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library to create a real-time facial recognition system. Dive into the world of computer vision and machine learning as we guide you through the setup and execution of this fascinating application.

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a real-time face detection and recognition system using the renowned OpenCV library and the highly accurate face_recognition library. Our script seamlessly captures video from your default camera, identifies faces frame by frame, and recognizes individuals from a set of pre-loaded images.

## Prerequisites
Before embarking on this visual journey, ensure that your machine is equipped with:
- Python 3.x
- A working camera

## Installation
To set the stage for our facial recognition adventure, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
